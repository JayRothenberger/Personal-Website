    <p> Hi, as you probably know, my name is Jay Rothenberger.  I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of
        Oklahoma (OU) studying Computer Science under <a href="http://www.diochnos.com/">Dimitris Diochnos</a>.
        I built this website in Django.  If you want to look under the hood the code is all available on my Github account.
        If you find any vulnerabilities or poor practices, of which I am very confident there are multiple, I’d appreciate
        it if you sent me an email or a text about it.  There are some of the Django production checklist items I have not
        done as I am not finished developing the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am deeply passionate about Machine Learning, Machine Learning Security, and Data Science, but I am also interested in video game design,
        and naturally the intersection of any two of the three. My Github is a bit of a mess, but there are a lot of lines of code I have
        written available there.  I'll be adding personal projects to my github and blog page as I complete them.
    </p>

                        In many practical computer vision scenarios unlabeled data is plentiful, but labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning which leverages unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised classifiers have received significant attention in recent literature. One major class of semi-supervised algorithms is co-training. In co-training two different models leverage different independent and sufficient "views" of the data to jointly make better predictions. During co-training each model creates pseudo labels on unlabeled points which are used to improve the other model. We show that in the common case when independent views are not available we can construct such views inexpensively using pre-trained models. Co-training on the constructed views yields a performance improvement over any of the individual views we construct and performance comparable with recent approaches in semi-supervised learning, but has some undesirable properties. To alleviate the issues present with co-training we present Meta Co-Training which is an extension of the successful Meta Pseudo Labels approach to two views. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-10% with very few training resources, as well as outperforming prior semi-supervised work on several other fine-grained image classification datasets.
