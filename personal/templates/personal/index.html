        <p>   Hi, as you probably know, my name is Jay Rothenberger.  I’m a software developer finishing their education at the University of Virginia this year.  This is my little corner of the internet.  I built all of it with Django and a few other libraries.  If you want to look under the hood the code is all available on my Github account.  If you find any vulnerabilities or poor practices, of which I am very confident there are multiple, I’d appreciate it if you sent me an email or a text about it.  There are some of the Django production checklist items I have not done as I am not finished developing the application.

            I am interested in pursuing a career in data science, game development, or more generally industry software development.  If you’d like to see some of the things I have done you can check out my resume page, or the little applets I have created on this site.  My Github is a bit of a mess, but there are a lot of lines of code I have written available there.  In the near future I’ll be adding some of the applied machine learning projects I have completed with keras.
